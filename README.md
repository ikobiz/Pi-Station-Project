# Pistation Project

Pistation is a step-by-step guide for installing Windows 11 ARM64 on a Raspberry Pi 5—using real hardware, a real SSD, UEFI firmware, and zero streaming tricks. This is a full desktop-class setup, built from scratch, and documented with obsessive care.

It’s designed for tinkerers, retro computing fans, and anyone interested in pushing boundaries while staying grounded in practicality.

## Project Structure

- Step 1: Hardware Setup  
- Step 2: Flash UEFI Firmware  
- Step 3: Configure UEFI  
- Step 4: Create the Installer  
- Step 5: Install Windows  
- Step 6: Tweak It (manual configuration and customization)

Each page is written so that even beginners can follow—no assumptions, no skipped steps.

## Why?

Because it’s possible. Because getting Windows to run on a Pi 5 using native drivers and SSD storage shouldn’t be reserved for obscure forums and blurry YouTube videos. This project is here to make that experience replicable, reliable, and honestly kind of fun.
