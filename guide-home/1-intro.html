      <h2>Welcome to the Pistation Project</h2>
      <p><strong>Pistation</strong> is a hands-on guide for turning a Raspberry Pi 5 into a fully functioning Windows 11 machine. This isn’t an emulator, a launcher, or a web skin. It’s raw Windows running on ARM64, booted from SSD, installed directly onto bare hardware. Because why not.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        This is a hardware-level install. No safety nets, no training wheels. You're doing something the Pi Foundation never intended—Bill Gates can’t stop us now.
      </div>

      <h3>What Pistation Gives You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Real Windows 11 ARM64 running off NVMe storage</li>
        <li>UEFI boot via firmware replacement</li>
        <li>A compact, silent, fanless PC powered by hobby-grade hardware</li>
        <li>Optional shell tweaks and retro builds for that early-2000s charm</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cost Breakdown</h3>
      <p>Your total cost depends on what you already own:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum: $95–$110</strong>  
          (You already have a microSD card and USB flash drive. You'll need a Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB), SSD, and NVMe HAT.)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Maximum: $180–$250+</strong>  
          (You need everything: Pi 5 (8GB), NVMe HAT, SSD, microSD card, flash drive, keyboard, mouse, power supply, display, case, cables, and cooling.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can install Windows without a license key for testing. For long-term use or any business scenario, activation with a valid key is required.</p>

      <h3>Risks & Real Talk</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Not all SSDs or USB adapters work reliably with the Pi 5</li>
        <li>Thermal throttling may occur under sustained loads</li>
        <li>You might void warranties, overwrite firmware, or brick a bootloader if you're reckless</li>
        <li>Windows ARM has limited software and driver support</li>
        <li>This setup is not endorsed by Microsoft or the Raspberry Pi Foundation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Time Needed</h3>
      <p>Even if everything goes smoothly (which it won’t), this isn’t a quick project. Here’s a realistic breakdown:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flashing firmware and setup tools: 20–30 minutes</li>
        <li>Creating the installer and applying custom tweaks: 15 minutes to 2+ hours</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting SSDs, boot issues, or weird USB behavior: 30 minutes to several hours</li>
        <li>Installing Windows 11: 45 minutes to 3 hours or more depending on your gear</li>
        <li>Shell tweaking, driver fixes, and finishing touches: however long your obsession lasts</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Estimated total time:</strong> 2 to 6+ hours. Longer if you're unlucky or very picky. Snacks recommended.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        This isn’t a toy OS mod or themed Linux skin. If you follow this guide, you’ll end up with a real, bootable Windows install running from real hardware. You’re not pretending—and that’s the whole point.
