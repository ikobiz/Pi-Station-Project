      <h2>Welcome to the Fun Part</h2>
      <p>Your system is up and running—but right now, it’s stock Windows on a Pi. This page is your playground. Whether you're tuning performance, changing how it looks, or turning it into something wildly custom, this is where it happens.</p>

      <!--<h3>⚙️ System Cleanup & Debloat</h3>
      <p>[Insert your favorite tips or tools here for removing unnecessary apps, disabling telemetry, or streamlining Windows for ARM performance.]</p>

      <h3>🚀 Speed & Responsiveness Tweaks</h3>
      <p>[Add performance tips like enabling High Performance mode, disabling animations, trimming startup apps, etc.]</p>

      <h3>🎨 Visual Customization</h3>
      <p>[This is where you drop your retro themes, wallpapers, and shell replacements. Include notes for classic start menus, XP-like icons, and custom sounds if desired.]</p>

      <h3>🧰 Useful Tools</h3>
      <p>[List any utility tools, automation scripts, launchers, or diagnostics you think are helpful for Pistation owners. Could be taskbar pinning scripts or lightweight file explorers.]</p>

      <h3>🔧 Optional Shell Replacement</h3>
      <p>[If you’re building a console-like experience or replacing Explorer entirely, describe your preferred shell setup and how to make it default after login.]</p>

      <h3>📚 Notes, Extras, and Secrets</h3>
      <p>[Add anything else here: Easter eggs, known issues, links to your GitHub projects, or a changelog for future updates.]</p>
