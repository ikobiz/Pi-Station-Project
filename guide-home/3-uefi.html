      <h2>Install UEFI Firmware on the Pi</h2>
      <p>This is the part where we prepare the Pi 5 to behave like a real PC: UEFI bootloader, NVMe support, proper boot selection, and a Windows-capable config.</p>

      <h3>1. Download the UEFI Firmware</h3>
      <p>Grab the official Pi UEFI build here:<br>
      <a href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi5/releases" target="_blank">UEFI Firmware for Raspberry Pi 5 (GitHub)</a></p>

      <h3>2. Prepare a microSD Card</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a 4GB+ card (formatted FAT32)</li>
        <li>Create a folder named <code>EFI</code> on the card</li>
        <li>Inside <code>EFI</code>, create a folder named <code>BOOT</code></li>
        <li>Extract the firmware zip and copy the <code>RPI_EFI.fd</code> file to <code>/EFI/BOOT/</code></li>
        <li>Also place the <code>bootaa64.efi</code> file in the same folder</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Insert and Boot</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Insert the microSD into your Pi</li>
        <li>Power it on — you should see the Raspberry Pi UEFI boot screen</li>
        <li>Press <code>Esc</code> or <code>Del</code> to enter the setup menu</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Tweak These Settings (One-Time)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to <strong>Device Manager > Raspberry Pi Configuration</strong></li>
        <li>Enable <strong>NVMe support</strong> under PCIe</li>
        <li>Set the default boot device to <strong>NVMe</strong> (or USB if you're installing from a drive)</li>
        <li>Disable unnecessary video outputs if you’re only using one screen</li>
        <li>Save changes and reboot</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        This replaces the default Pi bootloader with UEFI. You can still revert later by removing the microSD card, but keep backups anyway.
      </div>

      <p>With UEFI ready, we’re almost in Windows territory. Next step: creating the Windows installer (with attitude).</p>

	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<div class="highlight">
  <strong>Problem:</strong> No video output or blank screen  
  <br><strong>Fix:</strong> Double-check your HDMI cable and make sure the correct port is used (port 0 is closer to the USB-C). Some displays are picky—try another screen or adapter.

  <hr>

  <strong>Problem:</strong> Red LED flashes or stays solid with no activity  
  <br><strong>Fix:</strong> The Pi might not be reading the microSD card. Reformat it (FAT32), make sure the folder is named <code>uefi</code> (not <code>EFI</code>), and double-check file placement. Also confirm the card isn't corrupted or write-locked.

  <hr>

  <strong>Problem:</strong> UEFI menu appears, but no boot devices are listed  
  <br><strong>Fix:</strong> Go into Device Manager > Raspberry Pi Configuration and make sure PCIe support and NVMe are enabled. Also check that your HAT and SSD are properly seated and powered.

  <hr>

  <strong>Problem:</strong> Stuck at the boot menu or system freezes  
  <br><strong>Fix:</strong> Bad SSD, incompatible HAT, or a Pi that's just in a mood. Try removing the SSD and booting without it, then reinsert after adjusting config. If needed, update the UEFI firmware from GitHub.

  <hr>

  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Never assume the Pi likes your accessories. Cheap USB hubs, flaky SSDs, and bargain-bin microSD cards can cause ghost problems. Always suspect hardware first.
